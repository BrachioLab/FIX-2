Key anatomical landmarks include the cystic duct, cystic artery, and the common bile duct. The critical view of safety must be achieved before any clipping or cutting, ensuring that only two structures (the cystic duct and artery) are entering the gallbladder.\n\n### Safe Regions:\n1. **Cystic Duct and Artery**: These should be clearly identified and isolated. The area where these structures are clearly visible and separated from the common bile duct is considered safe for clipping and cutting.\n2. **Gallbladder Fundus**: The area around the fundus, away from the liver bed, is generally safe for dissection.\n\n### Unsafe Regions:\n1. **Common Bile Duct**: This structure should be avoided to prevent bile duct injury. It is typically located medially and inferiorly to the cystic duct.\n2. **Liver Bed**: Excessive dissection into the liver bed can cause bleeding and should be approached with caution.\n3. **Hepatic Artery**: Located near the cystic artery, care must be taken to avoid this structure.\n\n### Tissue Types:\n- **Fibrous Tissue**: Surrounding the cystic duct and artery, which should be carefully dissected to avoid injury to the bile duct.\n- **Adipose Tissue**: May obscure the view and should be cleared to achieve the critical view of safety.\n\n### Pathology/Abnormalities:\n- **Inflammation or Adhesions**: These can obscure anatomical landmarks and increase the risk of injury.
