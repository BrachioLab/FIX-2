The safe region for dissection is within the hepatocystic triangle after clearing the fat and fibrous tissue to expose two and only two structures entering the gallbladder (cystic duct and cystic artery).\n\nKey anatomical considerations for safe/unsafe regions:\n- SAFE: The anterior and posterior windows of the hepatocystic triangle have been cleared\n- UNSAFE: The medial aspect near the common bile duct/hepatic duct junction must be avoided\n- UNSAFE: Deep dissection into the liver bed should be avoided to prevent vascular injury\n- SAFE: The cleared area showing the cystic structures isolated from surrounding tissue\n\nThe tissue appears slightly inflamed with some adhesions, suggesting possible chronic cholecystitis. This makes identification of the safe plane more challenging and requires careful dissection to stay within the proper anatomical planes while achieving the critical view of safety before any structures are clipped or divided.",
