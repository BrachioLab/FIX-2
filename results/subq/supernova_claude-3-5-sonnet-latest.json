This is closely related to the concept of monotonic flux trends, especially in the context of active galactic nuclei (AGN) where such clear, stable trends can be expected.

Although the claim doesn\u2019t specify filter characteristics or the specific light curve shape (which would strengthen the alignment), the observation of a peak being \"bluer\" is indicative of a morphological feature typically analyzed under the context of secondary maxima. Thus, the alignment is strong, but not perfect, hence the rating of 0.7.",

This aligns strongly with the category of Secondary maxima as it emphasizes the importance of wavelength behavior at peak brightness, which is a critical feature in distinguishing some supernova classes. The alignment rating is high at 0.9, as it captures the essence of the claim well, though it does not explicitly detail the morphology of the light curve.",

However, since the claim does not detail the presence of multiple maxima or spectral features explicitly, the alignment is moderate rather than strong.",

The mention of a smooth decline also ties into this category, as it suggests a structured evolution of brightness consistent with the dynamics of certain supernova types. The inclusion of blue-to-red evolution indicates a change in spectral characteristics, but this is less relevant for the photometric amplitude classification. Overall, the alignment is strong due to the emphasis on amplitude and light curve shape."
