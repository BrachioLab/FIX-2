Three bits of information (lean on conservative)
* Included / Excluded
* Input-specific / General (IS/IG). IG: Gallbladder is usually safe to cut.
* Task-specific / Genral (TS/TG). TG: You should not cut in the gallbladder.
* Factually true / factually false / Factually maybe (T/F/M)


NOTE: some combinations are borderline, or may be impossible to exist in our datasets.
SOme examples may appear absurd (... because they are!)


## Included:

Input-specific / Task-specific / Factually true: 1.0    // "The gallbladder is in the upper right region"
Input-specific / Task-specific / Factually false: 0.0   // "Omega-m is low here" (actually high)

Input-specific / Task-general / Factually true: 0.0     // "You should cut in the safe region"
Input-specific / Task-general / Factually false: 0.0    // "You should cut in the unsafe region"
Input-specific / Task-general / Factually maybe: 0.0    // "The AMBIGIOUS AREA is safe to cut in" (sometimes true, sometimes false)

Input-general / Task-specific / Factually true: 0.0     // "Massmap images are typically shown in blue/gray/red/yellow"
Input-general / Task-specific / Factually false: 0.0    // "Massmap images typically have a lot of brown"
Input-general / Task-specific / Factually maybe: 0.0    // "Massmap images tend to have darker shades of color"

Input-general / Task-general / Factually true: 0.0      // "Cholec dissection images fed to ML models usually have gallbaldders present"
Input-general / Task-general / Factually false: 0.0     // "Cholec dissection images fed to ML models usually have heart visible"
Input-general / Task-general / Factually maybe: 0.0     // "Massmap images contain voids" (this might not be true sometimes)

Exact cases: 0.0 / 1.0
Included + Factually True + Expert-relevant: 1.0    ("The gallbaldder is in the upper-left corner")
Included + Factually True + General knowledge: 0.0  ("You should cut in the safe region")
Included + Factuall False + Expert-relevant: 0.0    ("The gallbaldder [which isn't visible] is in the upper-right")
Included + Factually False + General knowledge: 0.0  (hallucination + incorrect filtering, "The ")
Excluded + 


Vague cases (things that make you go hmm for >5 seconds; primarily have to do with factuality):
Included + Factually half-true + Expert-relevant: 0.5 ("The XXX value is moderate-to-high", [true answer: high]). ("This region is safe for dissection", actual answer: not very clear, but not untrue)
